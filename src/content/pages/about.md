**Sonic Sensory Lab** focuses on sonification and sonic intervention, aiming to translate everyday occurrences into the auditory sensorium as a counterpoint to the overwhelming influence of visual culture.

Inspired by early cybernetic art practices, the team blends digital and analog strategies to explore the relationships between technology, humans, and the environment, creating immersive and organic sensorial experiences.

Our diverse projects include experimental soundscapes, interactive installations, crowd participation, international collaborations, and educational activities.
