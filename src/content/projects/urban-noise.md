# Urban Noise Harvesting

**Location**: Ximending, Taipei
**Status**: Ongoing

## Concept

Modern cities are overwhelmed by sonic pollution. *Urban Noise Harvesting* acts as a filter, recording street noise and using AI to classify and reorganize specific frequencies into harmonious chords.

### The Algorithm

The system listens for:
- 🚨 Sirens (High Pitch) -> Converted to **Strings**
- 🚌 Bus Engines (Low Rumble) -> Converted to **Bass**
- 🗣️ Chatter (Mid Range) -> Converted to **Percussion**

## Interaction

Pedestrians can plug their headphones into the "Harvesting Stations" to hear the transformed version of the reality surrounding them.
