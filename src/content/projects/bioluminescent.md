# Bioluminescent Soundscapes

**Venue**: Taipei Fine Arts Museum
**Year**: 2024

## Project Overview

This project explores the unseen rhythm of bioluminescent bacteria. By using light sensors spread across a colony of *Vibrio fischeri*, we translate the intensity of their glow into a generative soundscape.

### Technical Setup

1.  **Bio-Reactors**: Custom glass vessels housing the bacteria.
2.  **Light Sensors**: High-sensitivity photodiodes capturing flux.
3.  **Max/MSP**: Converting data streams into granular synthesis parameters.

## Performance

The installation features a live performance where the biological data controls the lighting of the room, creating a feedback loop between the organisms and the participants.
