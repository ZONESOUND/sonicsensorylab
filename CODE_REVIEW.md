# Codebase Review: Sonic Sensory Lab

## 1. Project Overview
**Type:** Static Website
**Generator:** [Publii](https://getpublii.com/) (Open-Source CMS for Static Sites)
**State:** Production Build (Build Artifacts)

This repository appears to contain the **compiled output** of a website, rather than the raw source code. The files are minified and structured for deployment (likely to GitHub Pages), which is typical for Publii projects.

## 2. Key Observations
### A. Architecture
- **Generated Code:** The HTML contains metadata indicating it was generated by Publii.
- **File Structure:** Standard static site structure (`index.html`, `assets/`, `media/`, `feed.xml`).
- **Dependency Management:** There is no `package.json` or build script visible, confirming that the "build" happens outside this repo (likely in the Publii desktop app).

### B. Content & Navigation Issues
I noticed some likely placeholder/debug values in the main navigation bar in `index.html` (and potentially other pages):
- **"test"** -> Links to `contact.html`
- **"ohoh"** -> Links to `articles.html`

These label names seem accidental and should probably be renamed to "Contact" and "Articles" (or "News").

### C. Technical Details
- **SEO:** The site has good SEO foundations.
    - Open Graph (OG) tags are present for social sharing.
    - JSON-LD Structured Data (`Organization` schema) is implemented.
    - `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` are correctly configured.
- **Performance:**
    - Lazy loading for images is implemented via a custom script and `loading="eager"`/`loading="lazy"` attributes.
    - Resources are minified.
- **Routing:** Links use **absolute URLs** (e.g., `https://zonesound.github.io/sonicsensorylab/...`).
    - *Note:* This can sometimes make local development tricky if you open the HTML file directly instead of running a local server, as links might try to go to the live site.

## 3. Recommendations

### Scenario A: You use the Publii App
If you have the Publii desktop application installed and this project loaded:
1.  **Do not edit these files directly.** Your changes will be overwritten the next time you sync/render from Publii.
2.  Open Publii, go to the **Menus** section, and rename "test" to "Contact" and "ohoh" to "Articles".
3.  Re-sync your website.

### Scenario B: You want to edit manually (No Publii)
If you no longer use Publii or want to maintain this as a standard code project:
1.  We can manually fix the navigation labels in the HTML files.
2.  We should be aware that header/footer changes must be repeated across *all* HTML files (since we don't have a template engine currently configured in this output).
3.  Long-term, we could migrate this to a developer-friendly static site generator (like Vite, Next.js, or Astro) so you can use components and avoid repeating code.

### Scenario C: Moving to a Fresh Stack
If you want to modernize the site or add complex features (as per the "Web Application Development" profile):
1.  We can treat these files as a "reference" and rebuild the site using a modern framework (e.g., React/Vite).
2.  This would allow for easier styling updates, dynamic content, and a cleaner codebase.
