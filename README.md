# Sonic Sensory Lab

**Managed by ZONESOUND CREATIVE**

Sonic Sensory Lab is a non-profit platform dedicated to exploring the intersection of sound, technology, and interactive art. Our mission is to serve as a dynamic communication hub for our exhibitions, projects, residencies, and experimental research. The website is primarily in English and is designed to be easily updated by team members using a user-friendly backend.

## Objectives

- **Easy Content Management:**  
  Integrated with Decap CMS for a straightforward, Markdown-based editing experience. This setup allows team members, including interns and administrative staff, to update content quickly without technical overhead.

- **Modern, Customizable Design:**  
  Built using the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme, the site features a clean, two-column layout. Custom CSS modifications ensure a direct and uncluttered visual presentation that aligns with our institutional image.

- **Effective External Communication:**  
  The website acts as our public face, showcasing our projects and experimental initiatives to the world, fostering collaboration and outreach within the art and technology communities.

- **Non-Profit & Sustainable:**  
  By leveraging free and open-source technologies (such as Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and Decap CMS), the site is maintained at minimal cost while remaining highly flexible and accessible.
